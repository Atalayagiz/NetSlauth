Network Connection Monitor with VirusTotal Integration
This Python application monitors network connections established by processes on the system in real-time and checks the reputation of remote IP addresses using the VirusTotal API. It provides a comprehensive overview of network activities, highlighting potentially malicious connections.

---

Features: 
Real-time Monitoring: Utilizes the psutil library to track network connections established by processes.
VirusTotal Integration: Queries the VirusTotal API to determine the reputation of remote IP addresses. It assesses whether an IP is malicious or harmless based on VirusTotal analysis.
Connection Logging: Logs timestamped details of connections, including remote IP addresses and ports, along with the VirusTotal result.
Previous Connection Tracking: Maintains a record of previous connections to identify new connections established since the application's last run.
Exception Handling: Handles exceptions gracefully, ensuring uninterrupted monitoring even in the event of network errors or API failures.

Usage: 
Setup Environment: Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed, including psutil, requests, and dotenv. Set up a .env file with your VirusTotal API key.

Run Application: Execute the Python script to start monitoring network connections. The application will continuously monitor connections until interrupted.

Monitoring: View real-time network connections and their VirusTotal reputation. The application logs this information to a text file for future reference.
